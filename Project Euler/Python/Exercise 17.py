# Problem 17
# ==========
#
#
#    If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four,
#    five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.
#
#    If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written
#    out in words, how many letters would be used?
#
#    NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and
#    forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains
#    20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance
#    with British usage.
